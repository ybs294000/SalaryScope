## Overview

SalaryScope allows users to predict salaries either manually, via resume upload (hybrid extraction using spaCy and rule-based techniques), or in bulk (via file upload). It supports two prediction models targeting different domains — a general salary dataset and a data science-specific salary dataset. The app includes scenario analysis, model analytics, dataset exploration, basic tax estimation, cost-of-living adjusted salary insights, and extended financial analysis tools such as CTC breakdown, take-home salary estimation, savings potential, loan affordability insights, user authentication, prediction feedback collection, and PDF report generation.

A Model Hub module allows admins to upload additional independently trained sklearn-compatible models and make them available to logged-in users through a dynamically generated prediction interface, without modifying application code.

The project follows a structured workflow:
- Data analysis and model development using Jupyter notebooks
- Additional visualization through Power BI dashboards
- Model training and evaluation
- Integration of trained models into a Streamlit-based web application
- Storage and feedback collection using Firebase

The focus of the project is to combine machine learning with an interactive application interface, providing both prediction capabilities and supporting insights for better understanding of salary patterns. The system also includes basic financial context tools such as post-tax estimation and cost-of-living adjustment to improve real-world interpretability of predictions. The system also incorporates a feedback-driven learning layer to progressively improve model performance using real-world user data.

The application runs in a web browser, making it platform-independent and easily accessible.

## Live Demo

:link: SalaryScope is deployed on Streamlit Cloud with two versions:

- **Full App (Complete Feature Set):**  
  https://salaryscope-app.streamlit.app/

- **Lite App (Core Prediction Features):**  
  https://salaryscope-lite-app.streamlit.app/

### Full App vs Lite App

| Feature | Full App | Lite App |
|---|---|---|
| Manual Prediction | ✅ | ✅ |
| Batch Prediction | ✅ | ✅ |
| Model Analytics | ✅ | ✅ |
| Data Insights | ✅ | ✅ |
| User Profile | ✅ | ✅ |
| Resume Analysis (NLP) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Scenario Analysis | ✅ | ❌ |
| Model Hub | ✅ | ❌ |
| Admin Panel | ✅ | ❌ |
| Financial Planning Tools (11 modules) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Prediction Feedback System | ✅ | ❌ |
| HR & Employer Tools | ✅ | ❌ |
| AI Assistant | ✅ | ❌ |
| Interview Prep | ✅ | ❌ |

The lite app was built to stay within Streamlit Cloud free-tier memory limits by removing the most resource-intensive features and their dependencies (spaCy, pdfplumber, HuggingFace Hub, and the full financial tools chain). Both apps share the same Firebase project, so prediction history is unified across them.

The repository contains the complete implementation in `app_resume.py`. The lite app entry point is `app-lite.py`.

- Intended for comparison and insight, not exact financial planning

### Financial Planning Tools

A suite of 11 modular, toggle-based financial planning tools that appear below prediction results. Each tool is independently toggleable and operates on the predicted salary:

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| **Currency Converter** | What is my salary in another currency? |
| **Post-Tax Estimator** | What do I take home after income tax? |
| **Cost-of-Living Adjuster** | What salary would give equivalent purchasing power elsewhere? |
| **CTC Breakdown** | What are the components of my gross compensation package? |
| **Take-Home Estimator** | What is my net monthly in-hand after all deductions? |
| **Savings Potential** | How much can I realistically save each month? |
| **Loan Affordability** | How large a loan can I service on my income? |
| **Budget Planner** | How should I allocate my monthly net income? |
| **Investment Growth Estimator** | What will my savings be worth in 5, 10, 20, 30 years? |
| **Emergency Fund Planner** | How large a safety net do I need and how long to build it? |
| **Lifestyle Budget Split** | How should I split my discretionary income? |

All tools use country-specific data (tax brackets, CoL indices, expense ratios, loan rates, expected investment returns) sourced from Numbeo, OECD, World Bank, and government portals (2023/24). Results are approximate estimates intended for planning purposes, not financial advice.

### HR & Employer Tools

A dedicated tab providing compensation planning and benchmarking tools for HR teams and hiring managers. All tools use the currently active ML model for salary estimates and expose per-tool HR overrides so internal policy values can substitute the model output without losing the original estimate. The tab and each sub-tool are independently removable without affecting any other part of the application.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Hiring Budget Estimator** | Predict salary for a role profile and compute total annual payroll cost given headcount and adjustable employer cost assumptions (benefits %, overhead %, one-time recruiting cost); bar chart cost breakdown and CSV export |
| **Salary Benchmarking Table** | Generate a reference grid of model predictions across all experience levels for a selected role and location; editable in-place with HR Override, Band Min, Band Max, and Internal Notes columns; exported as CSV |
| **Candidate Comparison** | Compare expected salary for 2 to 5 candidates side by side; each candidate has independent profile inputs and an optional individual override; salary spread flagged; CSV export |
| **Offer Competitiveness Checker** | Compare a planned offer against the model's salary estimate using a gauge chart; tiered interpretive guidance; CSV export |
| **Team Compensation Audit** | Upload a CSV of current team salaries; vectorised batch predictions run once on upload and cached in session state; configurable underpaid/overpaid thresholds and a global percentage adjustment for systematic model offset; scatter plot, delta histogram, flagged records table; CSV export |

**HR override system:** every tool exposes a collapsible override section allowing the model estimate to be replaced with an internal reference value. Override reasons are captured as free text and included in all CSV exports alongside the original model estimate.

### Admin Panel (Diagnostics & Monitoring)

## Model Hub

The Model Hub is a separate tab that allows admins to upload additional independently trained models and make them available to logged-in users, without changing application code.

### How it works

Admins train models offline and upload a bundle in one of two formats:

**ONNX format (recommended):**

| File | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `model.onnx` | Yes | ONNX-serialised computation graph — no arbitrary code execution on load |
| `columns.json` | Yes | JSON array of feature column names the model expects |
| `schema.json` | Yes | Defines the user-facing input fields and their UI widget types |
| `aliases.json` | No | Display labels for selectbox model values |
| `skills.json` | No | Per-bundle skill lexicon for resume extraction (overrides global) |
| `job_titles.json` | No | Per-bundle job title alias map for resume extraction (overrides global) |
| `resume_config.json` | No | Per-bundle resume extraction config (overrides engine defaults for scoring, keywords, thresholds, and field mappings) |

**Pickle format (legacy, backward-compatible):**

| File | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `model.pkl` | Yes | Trained sklearn-compatible estimator, serialized with joblib |
| `columns.pkl` | Yes | Ordered list of feature column names the model expects |
| `schema.json` | Yes | Defines the user-facing input fields and their UI widget types |
| `aliases.json` | No | Display labels for selectbox model values |
| `skills.json` | No | Per-bundle skill lexicon for resume extraction (overrides global) |
| `job_titles.json` | No | Per-bundle job title alias map for resume extraction (overrides global) |
| `resume_config.json` | No | Per-bundle resume extraction config (overrides engine defaults for scoring, keywords, thresholds, and field mappings) |

Each upload creates a versioned folder in a private HuggingFace dataset repo (`models/model_<timestamp>_<id>/`). Bundles are never overwritten. A registry file (`models_registry.json`) tracks all uploaded models, their active status, and their bundle format.

### What users see

- A dropdown listing only active, registered models
- A Model Card expander showing structured metadata (intended use, metrics, training data, authors, links) when populated by the admin
- Four prediction modes after loading a bundle: Manual (single prediction with styled result card), Batch (CSV/XLSX upload with distribution chart and downloads), Resume (PDF extraction with editable review form and quality score), and Scenario (up to 5 named scenarios with comparison chart and optional sensitivity sweep)
- In Batch and Resume modes, uploading a new file clears previous results automatically; a Clear button is also available
- In Scenario mode, input fields are plain widgets — no save step is required before running
- No access to upload, registry management, or schema editing

### What admins can do

- Upload a complete bundle (ONNX: model.onnx + columns.json + schema.json, or Pickle: model.pkl + columns.pkl + schema.json)
- Attach Model Card metadata (intended use, out-of-scope, limitations, ethical notes, metrics, training data, authors, license, tags, links) at upload time via structured form fields and a raw JSON override
- Upload an optional aliases.json alongside the bundle, or push one separately after upload
- Upload optional per-bundle lexicons (skills.json, job_titles.json) to override global resume extraction defaults for this specific model
- Upload an optional resume_config.json alongside the bundle, or push one separately after upload, to override extraction engine defaults (scoring weights, keyword lists, experience thresholds, field-name mappings, preprocessing) for this specific model
- Activate or deactivate models from the Registry Manager
- Roll back to an earlier version within a model family
- Edit or create schema.json using a visual field builder with multi-column layout settings and result card label, then download it
- Upload a replacement schema.json, aliases.json, or resume_config.json to an existing bundle without re-uploading the model

### Schema system

`schema.json` defines the prediction form entirely. Supported field types:

```json
{
  "layout": { "columns": 2 },
  "result_label": "Predicted Annual Salary (USD)",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "experience_years", "type": "int",      "ui": "slider",    "min": 0, "max": 20,
      "row": 1, "col_span": 2 },
    { "name": "job_title",        "type": "category", "ui": "selectbox", "values": ["Data Scientist", "ML Engineer"],
      "row": 2, "col_span": 1 },
    { "name": "remote_ratio",     "type": "int",      "ui": "slider",    "min": 0, "max": 100,
      "row": 2, "col_span": 1 }
  ]
}
```

Supported `ui` values: `slider`, `selectbox`, `number_input`, `text_input`, `checkbox`.

**Optional top-level keys:**
- `layout.columns` (1, 2, or 3) — arrange fields in a responsive grid. Omitting gives a single-column form identical to existing schemas.
- `result_label` — label on the prediction result card. Overrides the registry target name.
- `plots` — list of chart descriptors rendered automatically in the appropriate mode. Supported types: `gauge`, `bar`, `horizontal_bar`, `scatter`, `histogram`, `line`. Charts with `x_field`/`y_field` use batch or scenario result data; `gauge` and single-value bar charts use the scalar prediction result.
- `scenario_sweep` — configures a sensitivity sweep in Scenario mode. Fields: `field` (schema field to vary), `mode` (`range` or `values`), `min`/`max`/`steps` for range mode, `values` and `value_labels` for discrete mode.

**Optional per-field layout keys:**
- `row` — integer; fields sharing the same row number are placed side-by-side.
- `col_span` — 1, 2, or 3; how many grid columns the field occupies. All layout keys are fully optional.

**Optional per-field extractor hint (Resume mode):**
- `extractor` — explicitly selects which resume extractor to use for this field, overriding the default name-based selection. Supported values: `experience`, `education`, `country_name`, `country_iso`, `senior_flag`, `job_title`, `employment_type`, `remote_ratio`, `skills_list`, `skills_str`, `age`.

### resume_config.json — per-bundle extraction override

An optional `resume_config.json` sidecar can be included in any bundle to override the resume extraction engine defaults for that specific model. Every key is optional — include only the settings you want to change. Bundles without this file continue to use the engine built-in defaults exactly as before.

`resume_config.json` is validated before upload (same as `aliases.json`) and can be pushed to an existing bundle without re-uploading the model via the Schema Editor tab.

#### Supported top-level keys

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `scoring` | object | Override scoring dimension weights and rubric |
| `extractors` | object | Override per-extractor keyword lists, patterns, and thresholds |
| `field_name_mapping` | array | Prepend extra keyword-to-extractor-id mappings |
| `preprocessing` | object | Override text preprocessing flags |

#### scoring block

```json
"scoring": {
  "experience_max":   40,
  "education_max":    30,
  "skills_max":       30,
  "skills_per_point": 3,

  "thresholds": {
    "entry":  { "max": 2,   "score": 8,  "note": "Entry level" },
    "mid":    { "max": 8,   "score": 20, "note": "Mid-level" },
    "senior": { "max": 9999,"score": 40, "note": "Senior level" }
  },

  "edu_map": {
    "0": [5,  "High school level"],
    "1": [15, "Bachelor level"],
    "2": [22, "Master level"],
    "3": [30, "PhD level"]
  }
}
```

- `experience_max`, `education_max`, `skills_max` — maximum points for each scoring dimension. The three values do not need to sum to 100; the total is capped at 100 after summing.
- `skills_per_point` — points awarded per detected skill. `skill_score = min(skill_count * skills_per_point, skills_max)`.
- `thresholds` — named experience scoring bands. Each key is an arbitrary band name; each value requires `max` (upper bound in years), `score` (points to award), and `note` (display string). Bands are sorted by `max` ascending at runtime; the first band whose `max` >= detected years is applied.
- `edu_map` — education level scoring. Keys are string level integers (`"0"`, `"1"`, ...). Each value is a `[score, note]` pair. The engine's `education` extractor returns an integer level (0 = lowest education, 3 = highest by default). If your model's education field maps to a different number of levels you can extend the map to cover them (e.g. add `"4"` for a fifth level).

#### extractors block

Each key is a supported extractor identifier. Only include extractors you want to override.

```json
"extractors": {
  "experience": {
    "max_years": 35,
    "patterns": [
      "(\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\+?\\s*(?:years?|yrs?)\\s+(?:of\\s+)?(?:engineering)?\\s*experience",
      "(\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\+?\\s*(?:years?|yrs?)"
    ]
  },

  "senior_flag": {
    "keywords": ["senior", "lead", "principal", "professor", "fellow"],
    "experience_threshold": 13
  },

  "remote_ratio": {
    "remote_keywords":  ["fully remote", "wfh", "distributed team"],
    "hybrid_keywords":  ["hybrid", "flexible working", "split week"],
    "onsite_keywords":  ["on-site", "lab-based", "campus-based"]
  },

  "employment_type": {
    "part_time_keywords":  ["part-time", "intern", "trainee"],
    "freelance_keywords":  ["freelance", "independent consultant"],
    "contract_keywords":   ["contract", "fixed-term", "research fellowship"]
  },

  "age": {
    "min_age": 18,
    "max_age": 80
  },

  "job_title": {
    "keyword_fallback": [
      [["aerospace engineer", "aeronautical engineer"], "Aerospace Engineer"],
      [["data scientist", "applied scientist"],         "Data Scientist"]
    ]
  }
}
```

**Supported extractor ids and their override params:**

| Extractor id | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `experience` | `max_years` (number), `patterns` (list of regex strings) | Replaces the built-in pattern list when `patterns` is provided. `max_years` caps the upper bound of valid values found. |
| `senior_flag` | `keywords` (list of strings), `experience_threshold` (number) | Replaces the built-in keyword list when `keywords` is provided. `experience_threshold` overrides the years-of-experience auto-senior threshold (default 6). |
| `remote_ratio` | `remote_keywords`, `hybrid_keywords`, `onsite_keywords` (each a list of strings) | Replaces the built-in keyword list for whichever groups are provided. Missing groups fall back to built-in. |
| `employment_type` | `part_time_keywords`, `freelance_keywords`, `contract_keywords` (each a list of strings) | Same per-group replacement pattern as remote_ratio. |
| `age` | `min_age` (int), `max_age` (int) | Overrides the valid age range for the age extractor. |
| `job_title` | `keyword_fallback` (list of `[[keywords], title]` pairs) | Replaces the entire built-in keyword fallback list. Each entry is `[[kw1, kw2, ...], "Canonical Title"]`. Canonical titles must match a value in the schema field's `values` list exactly. |

All keyword overrides for a given group replace the built-in list entirely for that group — they do not append. To keep a built-in keyword, include it explicitly in the override list.

#### field_name_mapping

```json
"field_name_mapping": [
  ["years_experience", "experience"],
  ["work_mode",        "remote_ratio"],
  ["is_management",    "senior_flag"]
]
```

Each entry is a `[keyword_string, extractor_id_string]` pair. These are prepended to the built-in field-name lookup table and take priority over it. The keyword is matched as a substring of the lowercased schema field name. This allows models with non-standard field names (such as `years_experience` instead of `experience_years`) to route correctly without adding an explicit `"extractor"` key to every field in `schema.json`.

#### preprocessing block

```json
"preprocessing": {
  "strip_urls":      true,
  "max_text_length": 0
}
```

- `strip_urls` (bool, default `true`) — remove http and www URLs from the resume text before extraction. Useful to disable if URLs contain domain names the country extractor should read.
- `max_text_length` (int, default `0`) — truncate extracted text to this many characters before any extraction. `0` means no truncation. Useful for very long academic CVs where truncating early improves extraction speed at the cost of missing content in the tail.

#### Validation rules

`resume_config.json` is validated by `validator.validate_resume_config()` before upload. Rules:

- Unrecognised top-level keys produce a warning but do not block upload (forward-compatible).
- Unrecognised extractor ids produce a warning and the section is ignored.
- `thresholds` entries must each have `max` (number), `score` (number), and `note` (string).
- `edu_map` keys must be string integers; values must be `[score, note]` pairs.
- `field_name_mapping` entries must each be a two-element `[string, string]` list.
- `keyword_fallback` entries must each be `[[string, ...], string]`.
- Structural errors (wrong types, malformed JSON) block upload.

#### Relationship to other per-bundle sidecars

`resume_config.json` controls **how** extraction runs (scoring, keywords, thresholds). The lexicon sidecars control **what** it recognises:

| Sidecar | Controls |
|---|---|
| `skills.json` | Which skill phrases are detected (replaces global skills lexicon) |
| `job_titles.json` | Which job title aliases are recognised (replaces global job titles lexicon) |
| `resume_config.json` | Scoring weights, extractor keyword lists, experience thresholds, field-name routing |

All three are independent and optional. Any combination is valid.

### Column mapping

The predictor maps schema fields to model columns automatically:

- **Direct match** — field name equals column name
- **One-hot expansion** — a `selectbox` field named `job_title` with values `["Data Scientist", "ML Engineer"]` maps to columns `job_title_Data Scientist` and `job_title_ML Engineer` (sklearn get_dummies convention)
- **Unmatched columns** — filled with `0.0`; a warning is shown if this occurs

### Access control

- The tab requires login to access
- Upload, Registry Manager, and Schema Editor are visible only to admin users
- Non-admin users see only the model selector and prediction form

### Storage

Models are stored in a private HuggingFace dataset repo configured via `st.secrets`. Required secrets:

```toml
HF_TOKEN   = "hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"   # write-scope token
HF_REPO_ID = "your-username/your-repo"  # dataset repo
```

### Security notes

- ONNX bundles (model.onnx) are loaded via onnxruntime — no arbitrary code execution on deserialisation. This is the recommended format for new uploads.
- Pickle bundles (model.pkl) are deserialized using joblib (which uses pickle internally). Only upload pickle bundles you have trained yourself.
- File size limits are enforced: 200 MB for model files, 10 MB for columns files, 512 KB for schema.json and aliases.json.
- The tab is auth-gated — unauthenticated users cannot access it.

Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the project root. The full configuration is:

```toml
FIREBASE_API_KEY = "your_firebase_api_key"
ADMIN_EMAIL      = "admin@yourdomain.com"   # Email that receives admin privileges

[FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "your_project_id"
private_key_id = "your_private_key_id"
private_key = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
client_email = "your_service_account_email"
client_id = "your_client_id"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "your_cert_url"
```

To enable the Model Hub (full app only), add:

```toml
HF_TOKEN   = "hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"   # HuggingFace token with write scope
HF_REPO_ID = "your-username/your-repo"  # Private HuggingFace dataset repo
```

For local development, optionally add:

```toml
IS_LOCAL = true   # Enables local-only features (e.g. CoL index save/reset to disk)
```

The Model Hub will not load if `HF_TOKEN` and `HF_REPO_ID` are absent, but all other tabs remain unaffected. `ADMIN_EMAIL` is required for the Admin Panel tab; without it, no user has admin access.

To enable the cloud AI Assistant backend (full app on Streamlit Cloud), also add:

```toml
HF_SPACE_URL          = "https://your-space-name.hf.space"
HF_SPACE_API_NAME     = "/predict"
HF_SPACE_ACTIVE_MODEL = "qwen2.5:0.5b"
HF_CHAT_REPO_ID       = "your-username/salaryscope-ai-chat"
HF_CHAT_TOKEN         = "hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"   # optional if HF_TOKEN already has access
HF_SPACE_TIMEOUT      = "180"                       # optional
```

> **Note:** Never commit `secrets.toml` to version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

## Important Notes

* Firebase authentication requires valid credentials and may not function without proper configuration.
* The application is fully usable without authentication for core features such as manual prediction, scenario analysis, and model analytics.
* Feedback submission is available to all users including those not logged in.
* Resume parsing requires spaCy language model installation.
* The Model Hub tab requires login to access and requires `HF_TOKEN` and `HF_REPO_ID` to be configured in secrets.
* The AI Assistant tab supports anonymous use in local development, but on Streamlit Cloud it requires the user to be logged in so chat history can be tied to a real account.

## Security Features

* Email verification before account activation (Firebase email link)
* Password policy aligned with NIST SP 800-63B (2024) and OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet: minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character, no consecutive identical characters, common-password blocklist
* Two-layer rate limiting for all authentication actions (login, registration, password reset, password change, account deletion, email resend): session-state layer (per-tab) + Firestore layer (cross-session) — fails open on any error
* Secure password reset using Firebase email-based OOB code system
* Session management with 24-hour expiry enforced via `st.session_state`
* Firebase-managed authentication — no passwords stored in Firestore or application code
* Rate limit records in Firestore keyed by SHA-256 hash prefix of user email — PII is never stored in document IDs
* Model Hub upload restricted to admin users; file size limits enforced pre- and post-download (model files 200 MB max, schema/aliases/lexicons 512 KB max, resume_config.json 256 KB max); ONNX bundles loaded via onnxruntime (no arbitrary code execution); pickle bundles audited via joblib security log on every load; per-bundle lexicon and config JSON files are plain data with no execution risk
* Admin role determined by server-side email comparison only (case-insensitive, from `st.secrets`)

> Note: These features are implemented for application-level security and demonstration purposes. For production systems, additional hardening would be appropriate.

## Authentication & Database

- User registration and login is handled via **Firebase Authentication** (email and password)
- User profile data and prediction history are stored in **Firestore**
- Sessions are managed via Streamlit session state with a 24-hour expiry
- Passwords are handled entirely by Firebase — no plaintext credentials are stored

## Data Collection Strategy (Feedback-Driven Learning)

SalaryScope includes a feedback-driven data collection layer designed to improve future model performance over time.

### Key Concepts

- Combines model predictions with real-world user feedback
- Collects optional structured and contextual salary data
- Bridges differences between multiple datasets used in the system
- Builds a continuously improving dataset without relying solely on external sources

### What Gets Collected

- Prediction accuracy and user rating
- Actual or expected salary (optional)
- Extended structured data (if provided):
  - Compensation structure (base, bonus, equity)
  - Skills and certifications
  - Industry and company context
  - Role-level details (team size, reports, tenure)
  - Work conditions (hours, location type, visa status)

### Benefits

- Enables future model retraining with real-world data
- Improves generalisation beyond static datasets
- Captures real compensation complexity
- Reduces dataset bias and improves reliability

### Design Approach

- Fully optional data collection (non-intrusive)
- No impact on prediction workflow if skipped
- Stored separately in Firestore for clean data pipelines

---

## Limitations

- The models are trained on publicly available datasets and may not fully reflect current real-world salary trends.
- Model predictions depend on patterns present in the training data and may not generalize well to unseen roles or regions.
- Resume analysis uses a hybrid approach combining lightweight NLP (spaCy) and rule-based extraction, which may not accurately handle complex or heavily formatted resumes.
- Offer letter parsing uses rule-based extraction and works best on text-based documents with clearly stated compensation and employment terms; heavily styled or image-like PDFs may require manual correction.
- Predictions do not account for real-time factors such as market demand, company-specific policies, or economic changes.
- The confidence interval shown for Model 1 is an approximation based on training residuals and should be interpreted as an estimate rather than an exact range.
- Feedback submitted anonymously cannot be linked to a specific user session and is stored without any personal identifier.
- Currency conversion uses external exchange rate data and may not reflect real-time market fluctuations or transaction-specific rates.
- Companion currency-based PDF and DOCX reports for prediction tabs use the currently available exchange-rate data and are intended for reporting convenience rather than accounting-grade conversion.
- Tax estimation uses approximate effective rates and does not model detailed national tax rules.
- Cost-of-living adjustments are based on generalized indices and may not reflect individual lifestyle differences.
- Combined currency, tax, and COL adjustments are intended for comparative insight, not exact financial planning.
- CTC breakdown uses approximate country-level salary structures and may not reflect actual employer-specific compensation components.
- Take-home salary estimation uses effective tax rates and simplified deduction models; real payroll calculations may differ.
- Savings estimates are based on generalized expense ratios and do not account for individual lifestyle or financial obligations.
- Loan affordability calculations use standard EMI formulas and typical lender norms, but actual loan eligibility depends on credit profile and bank policies.
- Model Hub pickle bundles (model.pkl) are deserialized using joblib. Only upload pickle files from sources you control entirely. ONNX bundles (model.onnx) do not carry this risk.
- Model Hub predictions are only as reliable as the model and data used during training — the system does not validate model quality.
- Multilingual resume support covers experience year and education level extraction in German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Skill and job title extraction remains English-based. Resumes in unsupported languages will trigger a warning and extraction accuracy will be significantly reduced.
- Language detection uses statistical frequency analysis and may misidentify very short or mixed-language resume texts. A minimum confidence threshold is applied; texts below the threshold are treated as unknown rather than producing a false label.
- The AI Assistant is a supporting layer for explanation and drafting, not the source of salary prediction. It can make mistakes or produce incomplete wording and should be reviewed before use.
- On Streamlit Cloud, the AI Assistant depends on a free Hugging Face Space backend, so response speed and availability may vary more than the rest of the application.
- Rich Markdown-to-PDF export for AI Assistant outputs is optional. If `md2pdf` and its WeasyPrint requirements are unavailable, the app automatically falls back to the built-in ReportLab export path.
- Interview Prep results are only as strong as the authored question sets and answer keys. Timing and scoring depend on valid registry and set configuration.

## Future Scope

- Improve model performance by training on larger and more recent datasets.
- Enhance resume parsing using more advanced NLP techniques (e.g. transformer-based models) for better accuracy across diverse resume formats.
- Extend offer letter parsing with richer clause handling for benefits, vesting structures, and region-specific compensation terminology.
- Expand the system to support additional job roles and domains beyond current datasets.
- Use collected feedback data to retrain or calibrate models over time.
- Enhance financial estimation modules (CTC, take-home, savings, loan) with more accurate country-specific rules and real-world datasets.
- Integrate detailed tax systems with deductions, exemptions, and region-specific regulations for improved take-home accuracy.
- Extend ONNX support in the Model Hub to additional model architectures beyond sklearn-compatible estimators (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow via tf2onnx).
- Add education and country pattern lexicons as optional per-bundle sidecars (currently skills, job titles, and extraction config are per-bundle overridable; education patterns and country aliases still use only global lexicons).
- Extend multilingual resume support beyond the current five languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese) by adding experience and education patterns for additional languages; consider loading language-specific spaCy models for NER-based field extraction in non-English resumes.
- Allow `resume_config.json` to declare custom extractor functions by reference (plugin pattern) so model owners can add entirely new field extractors without forking the engine.
- Add city-level cost-of-living data to improve the granularity of COL adjustments beyond country averages.
- Implement real-time salary market data integration for more current predictions.
- Add Google OAuth as an alternative authentication method (infrastructure is partially scaffolded).
- Expand HR Tools with job-market demand data integration (live posting counts via a public API) to complement model-based salary estimates with demand signals.
- Add city-level cost-of-living support to the HR Team Audit so compensation gaps can be assessed at city granularity, not just country level.
- Expose HR Tools benchmarking grid as a downloadable formatted PDF report consistent with the existing ReportLab report system.
- Improve the AI Assistant with stronger grounding, richer report export workflows, and more polished contextual actions inside prediction and resume tabs.
- Improve AI Assistant export styling further, including richer Markdown-to-PDF theming when optional document-rendering dependencies are available.
- Expand Interview Prep with broader role libraries, richer section-level analytics, and optional AI-assisted answer review after submission.
- Extend companion report exports to additional sections such as batch analytics and model analytics where alternate-currency summaries may be useful.
- Explore more efficient cloud-friendly open models or alternative hosting strategies to improve AI Assistant latency and stability on free-tier deployments.
